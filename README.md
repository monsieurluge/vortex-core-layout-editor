# Vortex CORE Layout Editor

This project is a fork of [TsFreddie Much Programming Core project](https://github.com/TsFreddie/much-programming-core).

My intent is to do some refactoring, upgrade the sources, move to the latest version of the [VueJS Framework](https://vuejs.org/), add tests, and a decent development environment.
